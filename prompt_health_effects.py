    Analyze the clinical trial and classify the study focus based on the involvement of {compound_name} or its derivatives.
    1. Classify the study focus:
       - (1) {compound_name} as a Single Compound
       - (2) {compound_name} in Combination Therapy (f.e. with other compounds)
       - (3) A derivative of {compound_name}
       - (4) Comparative Analysis ({compound_name} or its derivatives  vs. Other Compounds or treatments)
       - (5) {compound_name} as Biomarker/Measurement (it is used to assess or track biological effects, not as a treatment)
       - (6) No Involvement ({compound_name} is not studied)
       - (7) Other Focus

    2. Extract any health benefits attributed to {compound_name} (or its derivatives) in the study, excluding adverse events, unrelated findings, or effects from other compounds. If none, return 'None'. Only return keywords.

    3. Extract any terms related to the study population/genotype (f.e. Obese, asian, women, rats, APOE Îµ4, etc.)

    The output should be structured as:
    - Study Focus: [Insert category number (1-7)]
    - Health Benefits: [List or 'None']
    - Population: [List or 'None']

    No explanation is needed.
