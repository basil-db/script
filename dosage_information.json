Patients were administered a questionnaire consisting of a quality of life (QoL) measure designed specifically for persons with CVD, and underwent tibiotarsal joint angle measurement and water plethysmography of the lower extremity before and 30 days after pharmacological intervention. Assessors were blind to the treatment groups. Nine patients dropped out of the trial. Data collected from the 127 remaining patients was considered for statistical analysis. There were no differences in tibiotarsal joint range of motion. Volume reductions \u2265100 mL were more frequent in the diosmin\u2009+\u2009hesperidin group than in any other group. QoL scores were best in the aminaphthone group, and between-group differences were found on individual analysis of questionnaire items.
